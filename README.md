Secure open-source package ecosystems by originating, validating, and augmenting
build attestations.

## Overview

[OSS Rebuild](https://oss-rebuild.dev/) aims to apply [reproducible build](https://reproducible-builds.org/)
concepts at low-cost and high-scale for open-source package ecosystems.

Rebuilds are derived by analyzing the published metadata and artifacts and are
evaluated against the upstream package versions. When successful, build
attestations are published for the upstream artifacts, verifying the integrity
of the upstream artifact and eliminating many possible sources of compromise.

We currently support the following ecosystems:

- npm (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- PyPI (Python)
- Crates.io (Rust)

While complete coverage is the aim, only the most popular packages within each
ecosystem are currently rebuilt.

## Usage

The `oss-rebuild` CLI tool provides access to OSS Rebuild data:

```bash
$ go run github.com/google/oss-rebuild/cmd/oss-rebuild@latest --help
$ # Alternatively, install the binary locally.
$ # Just make sure it's on your PATH: https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install
$ go install github.com/google/oss-rebuild/cmd/oss-rebuild@latest
$ oss-rebuild --help
```

To view the rebuild for a given package, use the `get` command:

```bash
$ oss-rebuild get pypi absl-py 2.0.0
```

By default, this provides only a summarized view. For more granular access to
rebuild data, use one of the `--output` formats. For example, to access the
entire attestation payload, use the `--output=payload` option:

```bash
$ oss-rebuild get pypi absl-py 2.0.0 --output=payload
```

To view the dockerfile, use the `--output=dockerfile` option. This can be
chained with `docker` to execute a rebuild locally:

```bash
$ oss-rebuild get pypi absl-py 2.0.0 --output=dockerfile | docker run $(docker buildx build -q -)
```

While the above `--output=payload` option produces more human-readable
content, the raw attestation bundle can be accessed as follows:

```bash
$ oss-rebuild get pypi absl-py 2.0.0 --output=bundle
```

To explore more packages, the `list` command can be used to view the versions of
a package that have been rebuilt:

```bash
$ oss-rebuild list pypi absl-py
```

### Usage Requirements

`oss-rebuild` uses a public [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs) key to validate attestation signatures.
Anonymous authentication is not supported so an [ADC credential](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) must be present.

This can be accomplished with:

```bash
$ gcloud init
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

To disable signature verification and skip the requirement for KMS access use: `--verify=false`.

## Purpose

- **Mitigate supply chain attacks**: Detect discrepancies in open-source
  packages, helping to prevent compromises like those of Solarwinds and
  Codecov.
- **Scale security standards**: Utilize industry best practices such as SLSA,
  Sigstore, and containerized builds.
- **Community participation**: Create a venue to collectivize effort towards
  securing the open-source supply chain.
- **Enable future innovation**: Derive data to leverage AI-driven rebuilds.

## Security

To better understand the security properties of rebuilds, see
[Trust and Rebuilds](./docs/trust.md).
