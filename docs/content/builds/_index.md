# Build Attestation Types

OSS Rebuild generates several types of build attestations to provide comprehensive verification of the rebuild process.

## Available Attestation Types

- **[Rebuild@v0.1](Rebuild@v0.1.md)** - Attests to the build process that reproduced the upstream artifact, including inputs, build definition, and builder details.
- **[ArtifactEquivalence@v0.1](ArtifactEquivalence@v0.1.md)** - Attests to the comparison between the rebuilt artifact and the upstream version.
- **[NetworkRebuild@v0.1](NetworkRebuild@v0.1.md)** - Attests to network-based rebuild processes.

For more information on how to access and verify these attestations, see our [Storage and Access guide](../storage.md).
