## Contribution process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Commit Structure

Pull Requests may use either Squash or Rebase PR merge strategies. For more
background, see
[the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github))
but to summarize:

- _Squash_: All PR commits are combined into one commit when merged.
- _Rebase_: All PR commits are merged as-is.

Feel free to cater your PR to whichever workflow you prefer.
